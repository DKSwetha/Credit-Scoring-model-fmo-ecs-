The Federated Multi-Objective Evolutionary Credit Scoring System (FMO-ECS) is a research implementation of a federated learning approach to credit scoring that enables multiple financial institutions to collaboratively optimize credit scoring models while maintaining strict data privacy and fairness guarantees. The system balances three competing objectives: prediction accuracy for identifying creditworthy applicants, fairness in treatment across demographic groups, and compliance with regulatory banking requirements. By employing multi-objective optimization techniques inspired by the NSGA-II algorithm, the system generates a diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions that allow practitioners to select models based on their institutional priorities and constraints.

System Architecture

The FMO-ECS architecture consists of three primary components: independent client institutions that maintain their own customer data and perform local optimization, a central server that aggregates optimal solutions from all clients without accessing raw data, and an evolutionary optimization engine that operates at both local and global levels. Each of the three participating financial institutions maintains a local population of candidate credit scoring models, optimizes these models against local data, and communicates only aggregated Pareto front solutions to the central server. The server then aggregates these solutions into a global Pareto front and broadcasts the consolidated best practices back to each client for integration into their local populations. This federated approach enables collaborative learning across institutions while preserving data privacy and allowing each institution to maintain control over its local optimization strategy.

Methodology

The optimization process operates over multiple communication rounds, with each round consisting of local optimization phases at each client followed by server-side aggregation. Within each client, the system employs a population-based evolutionary algorithm that maintains candidate solutions and applies genetic operators including mutation and crossover to generate new solutions. Each candidate solution is evaluated against three objectives: minimizing prediction error to maximize classification accuracy, minimizing fairness violations measured through demographic parity, and minimizing regulatory violations based on compliance constraints. The Pareto dominance relationship is used to identify solutions that cannot be improved on one objective without degrading performance on another, building a frontier of non-dominated solutions. After each round of local optimization, each client selects its best solutions and transmits them to the server, which performs multi-way aggregation to identify the global Pareto front, ensuring no individual institution's data is shared.

Experimental Results

The system was evaluated on a credit scoring dataset containing 1,000 customer records with 86 financial features distributed across three client institutions. The final global Pareto front consists of 12 Pareto-optimal solutions exhibiting the following performance characteristics. The best-performing solution achieves 81.48 percent prediction accuracy with 93 percent fairness and 88 percent regulatory compliance. The average solution across the Pareto front achieves 71.67 percent accuracy with 96 percent fairness and 88.2 percent regulatory compliance, placing the system within industry-standard ranges for credit scoring applications. A critical finding from the multi-objective analysis reveals a strong negative correlation of negative 0.7855 between prediction accuracy and regulatory compliance, indicating a fundamental tradeoff inherent to the credit scoring problem under the specified constraints. In contrast, fairness and regulatory compliance exhibit positive correlation of 0.4893, suggesting that fair models tend to be naturally more compliant with regulatory requirements. The Pareto front demonstrates good diversity with a diversity score of 0.392, indicating that practitioners have substantive choices across different points on the tradeoff frontier.
